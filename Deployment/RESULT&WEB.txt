RESULTS	AND DISCUSSION



In our experimentation with the Wisconsin dataset, we conducted a thorough evaluation of various machine learning and deep learning algorithms for the task of classifying breast cancer samples as either benign or malignant. After extensive testing, we found that the XGBoost algorithm consistently outperformed other models in terms of classification accuracy and overall performance.

The best-performing XGBoost model was determined through a process of hyperparameter tuning, where we systematically searched through different combinations of hyperparameters to identify the optimal configuration. The hyperparameters that yielded the best results for our dataset were:

- **Max Depth**: 6
- **Learning Rate**: 0.15
- **Min Child Weight**: 7
- **Gamma**: 0.2
- **Colsample_bytree**: 0.3

Here's a breakdown of each hyperparameter and its significance:

1. **Max Depth**: Specifies the maximum depth of each tree in the ensemble. A higher value allows the model to capture more complex relationships in the data, but increases the risk of overfitting.

2. **Learning Rate**: Controls the step size at each iteration while moving towards a minimum of the loss function. A lower learning rate typically results in more accurate models, but requires more iterations to converge.

3. **Min Child Weight**: Defines the minimum sum of instance weight (hessian) needed in a child. It helps prevent overfitting by constraining the minimum amount of samples required to create a new node in the tree.

4. **Gamma**: Specifies the minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. It acts as a regularization parameter by controlling the complexity of the trees.

5. **Colsample_bytree**: Denotes the fraction of features (columns) to be randomly sampled for each tree. It introduces randomness into the training process and helps prevent overfitting by promoting diversity among the base learners.

By fine-tuning these hyperparameters, we were able to optimize the performance of the XGBoost model for our specific dataset and achieve superior classification accuracy compared to other algorithms. This highlights the importance of hyperparameter tuning in maximizing the effectiveness of machine learning models.

WEB INTEGRATION


Web Integration Report

Machine Learning Model:
- Model Type: XGBoost Classifier
- Library: scikit-learn
- Training: The XGBoost classifier has been trained on a breast cancer dataset using scikit-learn.

Flask Backend:
- Framework: Flask
- Dependencies: Flask, Flask-CORS, joblib, pandas, scikit-learn
- Endpoint: /predict
- Functionality: 
  - Flask backend receives input data from the frontend through the /predict endpoint.
  - It preprocesses the received data, which includes converting it into a DataFrame using pandas.
  - The input data is then scaled using Min-Max scaling, which ensures that all features are on the same scale for modeling purposes.
  - After preprocessing, the XGBoost model loaded from a joblib file makes predictions on the preprocessed data.
  - The Flask backend sends the predictions back to the frontend for display.

React Frontend:
- Framework: React
- Dependencies: @mui/material, axios
- Components:
  - TextFields: TextFields are used for user input. Each TextField corresponds to a feature in the breast cancer dataset.
  - Button: A button component allows the user to submit the form with the input data.
  - Prediction Section: A section to display the predictions received from the backend after form submission.
  
Integration Process:
1. The user interacts with the React frontend, providing input data through the TextFields.
2. Upon submitting the form, the input data is sent to the Flask backend's /predict endpoint using axios(a library used for making HTTP requests).
3. Flask preprocesses the input data, scales it using Min-Max scaling, and makes predictions using the XGBoost model.
4. The predictions are sent back to the React frontend, where they are displayed to the user.

Overall Workflow:
- The integration between the Flask backend and React frontend allows for a seamless user experience.
- Users can input data related to breast cancer features through the frontend interface.
- The backend processes and analyzes this data using the trained XGBoost model, providing predictions back to the user interface.
- This integration enables efficient and effective utilization of machine learning models for real-world applications, such as cancer diagnosisÂ prediction.
